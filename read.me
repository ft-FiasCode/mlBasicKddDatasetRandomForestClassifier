# Network Traffic Classification Using Random Forest

## Overview
This project uses a machine learning method called Random Forest to classify network traffic data as either "normal" or "attack." It helps detect malicious activity automatically by learning patterns in historical data.

## Libraries Used
- **pandas**: For managing data in tabular format
- **scikit-learn**: For all machine learning tasks including model building, training, evaluation, and preprocessing
- **numpy** and **scipy**: Required libraries that support scikit-learn functions

## How It Works â€” Step-by-step

1. Load data from a CSV into a DataFrame.
2. Separate data into features (inputs) and labels (what to predict).
3. Fill missing values with the most frequent value in each column.
4. Convert categorical string features to numerical values.
5. Convert labels into binary form (0 = normal, 1 = attack).
6. Split data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets, keeping class proportions balanced (stratify).
7. Use GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for Random Forest.
8. Train the best model on the training data.
9. Evaluate the model using a confusion matrix and classification report.

## Key Concepts

- **Stratify**: Keeps the ratio of classes the same in both training and testing sets to avoid bias.
- **Random Forest**: Combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
- **Hyperparameters**: Settings like the number of trees (`n_estimators`) that govern how the model learns.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Accuracy:** Overall rate of correct predictions.
  - **Precision:** Correctness of "attack" predictions.
  - **Recall:** Ability to find all actual attacks.
  - **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## How to Run

1. Place your dataset (`KDDDataset.txt`) in the project folder.  
2. Install required libraries by running:  

pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy scipy

3. Run the Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) or Python script.  
4. View printed results to understand model performance.
